# Decentralized Naming Service

DexNS 3.0 contracts would be deployed soon.


## Description

Service provides an opportunity to register a key-phrase 'Name' and associate one address (wallet or contract) and one string variable (metadata) with each key-phrase. External contracts can access Naming Service variables as follows:

```js

// The following will initiate a call of address,
// that is associated with "Bit Ether Coin" string.
NamingService ns= new NamingService();
ns.addressOf("Bit Ether Coin").call(_gas)(_data);
```

Addresses or data can be accessed from the external contract. 
Naming Service content can't be blocked, removed or censored in any other way. Everyone is allowed to do whatever he/she wants with it.

# Details 

- `Name` is a key-phrase that will be associated with name data. Each `Name` contains:
    - `owner` the owner of Name.
    - `addr` associated address.
    - `value` stringified associated data.
    - `endblock` the number of block on which ownership of this Name expires.
    - `signature` sha256 hash of this Name key-phrase.
    

You can register Name and became its owner. You will own the name before the expiry of the `nameOwning` time. If no one will claim your Name after `expiration[Name]`, then you will continue to be the Name owner. If the Name will be re-registered after the expiration, then you will lose control over this Name. You can extend the term of ownership of the Name before it expires.

Functions:

- `registerName` function allows you to register a new key-phrase Name and become its owner.
- `updateName` function allows you to update Name content if you are Name owner.
- `changeNameOwner` function allows owner to transfer ownership to another address.
- `hideNameOwner` function allows to hide Name owner. If Name owner is hidden `getName(Name)` will return owner as 0x0 and `ownerOf(Name)` will throw an error.
- `associate` function allows you to assign owned Name to your address. It may be needed to replace hex-address shown on blockchain explorers by your Name.
- `extendNameBindingTime` function allows you to pay Name again and extend owning period by next `owningTime` blocks.
- `ownerOf` function allows to check who is Name owner. (for example it may be needed to check ownership in contract trading Names)
- `addressOf` will return address associated with Name.
- `valueOf` will return stringified data associated with Name.
- `endtomeOf` will return the block number on which ownership on given Name expires.
- `getAssociation` will return an assigned address if Name is inputed or assigned Name when address is inputed.

- `uint owningTime ` is a number of blocks you will own registered Name. (=1 500 000 now)
- `uint namePrice ` is amount of Ether that you need to pay to buy Name. (=0 now)
- `bool debug ` returns is a contract in debugging mode or not.
